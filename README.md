# IRP-Module-Manipulation
Code that manipulates IRP modules on a SUNY Broome server remotely.

If loading code to look through, only add one "Lab8...".cs file at a time. They are copies of eachother with diffrent outputs and results, 
which introduces many errors and warnings when associated together. The IP address the program connects to has since changed, thus the code 
will not run through the SUNY Broome IRP modules and is now only used for refrence.
